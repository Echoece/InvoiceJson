1. 
name? = not sure, invoice_title?
company Id = customer.companyId  (integer)
Tax Id = not sure yet, 
		Invoice entity has List<InvoiceItems> 
			Invoiceitems has List<InvoiceItemTax> 
				InvoiceItemTax has the taxcode and taxid (im assuming taxcode is the value i want? but it can have different type of tax, so it is not clear)                          
adress = is not clear, Invoice has -> billing address, shipping address. these are probably the ones i need,
			if not, then a customer has addresses and contacts. billing and shipping boolean in customer contact marks which is what.

2. 
Bill to:
name : Invoice.customer.name
adress = same as above.


Top right:
1.
Invoice # = Invoice.invoiceNo (string)

Invoice Date: 23 May 2022 format , Invoice.invoiceData

sub: Invoice of purchasing {seems first item on the Invoice.InvoiceItem.productName}
				Note: what about mutliple products? maybe can append text something like "and other products" at the end


2. item details list :
invoice.Invoiceitem. -> productDescription, productName, quantity, unitPrice, itemSubtotal

3. summary:
subtotal : Invoice.subtotal
discount : Invoice.discount  . Note: maybe add a check if discount > 0 , only then print it.
shipping addredss: not sure where is this coming from, i couldnt find it from ERD diagram so far.
list of taxes : from the image it looks like we need a groupby tax type and sum them up. Each InvoiceItems can have many tax types it seems from ERD.
				for now i will use a hardcoded json value.

total: Invoice.total
Balance Dues: Invoice.dues
